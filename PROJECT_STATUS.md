# PROJECT_STATUS.md — Nzwisiso AI Policy Dashboard (`policy-nexus`)

Source of truth for project state. **Read this FIRST at every session.**
Statuses: `NOT STARTED` / `IN PROGRESS` / `DONE`. Notes describe what is TRUE right now.
`DONE` only appears where it was verified in the same session it was written.

---

## Locked constraints (do not re-derive, do not "improve")
- **Palette LOCKED**: `src/index.css` `:root` — `--primary: 120 100% 20%` (emerald #006400),
  `--gold: 51 100% 50%` (#FFD700), `--success`, `--warning`. No new colour literals anywhere.
- **Typography LOCKED**: Inter + JetBrains Mono (`tailwind.config.ts` fontFamily). Self-hosted
  in Phase B to remove the Google Fonts CDN request — same faces.
- **One shared dashboard** for all 16 departments, config-driven. Never 16 dashboards.
- **Stack LOCKED**: Vite + React 18 + TS + Tailwind + shadcn/ui. Package manager **npm**
  (`bun.lock` exists — never run `bun install`, never regenerate it).
- **Design system LOCKED**: `src/components/ui/**` are stock primitives; not rewritten.
- **No new runtime dependency** without explicit user approval.
- `main` is never committed to or pushed to by an agent. Baseline tag
  `baseline-pre-unified-platform` → `7451db0` (restore with `git checkout main`).
- Branding: **Nzwisiso AI Policy Dashboard**, tagline **Understanding before action.**
  User-visible vocabulary: *Nzwisiso simulation core*, *Nzwisiso knowledge map*,
  *Nzwisiso agent memory*. Never expose MiroFish / OASIS / GraphRAG / Zep / Puter.
- Determinism: no `Math.random()`, no `Date.now()`, no `new Date()` for content.
  `REFERENCE_DATE = "2026-09-24"`. Same department + same policy ⇒ identical result.
- Scenario mode only: no backend, no DB, no AI APIs, no CDN scripts at runtime.

## Target route map (authoritative)
```
/                          Home (public, 16-department select)
/app                       Department dashboard (existing Index layout, department-aware)
/app/policies              Policy register
/app/simulations           Simulation register
/app/simulations/:id       Live deterministic simulation
/app/assessments/:id       Executive Summary + document actions
/app/assessments/:id/full  Full assessment
/app/documents             Secondary: department document library
/app/reference             Secondary: methodology & limitations
*                          NotFound (preserved)
```

## Department IDs (exact, 16)
`opc fin agri health edu hedu ict mines energy psc lg mfa env def zimra zida`

## Single source of truth (files that own data)
- `src/config/brand.ts` — product name, entity, tagline, disclaimer.
- `src/config/departments.ts` — the 16 departments + all authored department content.
- `src/config/reference.ts` — `REFERENCE_DATE`, reference rates, segment lists.
- `src/services/assessment/types.ts` — canonical assessment result schema.
- `src/services/assessment/AssessmentService.ts` — interface + factory (mock→real seam).

## WORK ITEMS

### Phase 0 — Safety + scaffolding + baseline gate
**Status: DONE — verified this session (commit `a2a5b7c`)**

- Branch `feature/unified-platform` + tag `baseline-pre-unified-platform`: **DONE** — verified
  `git branch --show-current` → `feature/unified-platform`; tag → `7451db0ed3879d94977a79813672e5a2778c232c`.
- `.clinerules/` 6 rules (00 continuity, 01 minimal context, 02 role router, 03 preserve UI,
  04 determinism+validation, 05 bug-fix-forward): **DONE** — 6 files created.
- `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`, `docs/ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md`: **DONE** — files created.
- `scripts/validate.mjs` + `npm run validate` / `typecheck` / `e2e` scripts: **DONE** — the
  validator runs and correctly reports the RED baseline (it fails loudly, as intended).
- `package.json` `name` → `nzwisiso-policy-dashboard`: **DONE** (line 2, verified).
- **BUG FIXED (bug-fix-forward rule)**: `npm install` failed `ERESOLVE` —
  `lovable-tagger@1.1.13` requires peer `vite >=5.0.0 <8.0.0` while the project pins
  `vite ^8.0.0` (and `@vitejs/plugin-react@6` requires `vite ^8`, so downgrading vite would
  break the build). Root-cause fix applied: `lovable-tagger` bumped `^1.1.13` → `^1.3.4`
  (peer `vite >=5.0.0 <9.0.0`, verified via `npm view`). Not fixed with `--legacy-peer-deps`.
- Global skills install: **DONE** — 26 skills installed globally to `~/.agents/skills/` and
  registered for **Cline** (verified with `npx skills ls -g`); resolved exact sources: `jakubkrehel/skills`
  (11 skills: better-accessibility, better-colors, better-interface, better-layout,
  better-typography, better-ui, better-writing, break, explain-interface, interface-review,
  variant), `jakubkrehel/make-interfaces-feel-better` (1), `jakubkrehel/oklch-skill` (1),
  `emilkowalski/skills` (13: animate, animate-expo, animation-vocabulary, apple-design,
  ask-sonner, emil-design-eng, find-animation-opportunities, improve-animations,
  mobile-native, pick-ui-library, prototype, review-animations, write-swift).
- `npm install`: **DONE** — 472 packages in 2m (attempt 2 after the fix);
  `lovable-tagger@1.3.4` verified via `require()`.
- **Baseline gate: DONE — GREEN.** `typecheck` EXIT=0; `build` EXIT=0 (1668 modules, 429ms;
  `tailwindcss-animate` still active — `accordion-down` present in the built CSS); `test` EXIT=0
  (5 tests); `lint` EXIT=0 after repair.
- **OTHER BUGS FOUND + FIXED in the baseline (bug-fix-forward rule)**:
  1. `npm run lint` FAILED with **5 pre-existing errors** / 7 warnings: `no-explicit-any` x2 in
     `PolicyInput.tsx` (untyped `window.puter`), `no-empty-object-type` in `ui/command.tsx` and
     `ui/textarea.tsx` (empty interfaces), `no-require-imports` in `tailwind.config.ts`. Fixed at
     root cause (typed Puter accessor; `type` aliases; ESM import). No rule downgrades, no
     `@ts-ignore`, no `eslint-disable`.
  2. `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` was only `warn`; now **`error`** (rule 06 requirement). The
     newly surfaced violations were fixed properly — `formatFileSize` hoisted to module scope in
     `PolicyInput`; unused `messages` dep removed from `AgentFeed`. NOTE (honest caveat): the
     `AgentFeed` streaming timer no longer restarts on every appended message — a timing nuance
     only; that component is replaced by the deterministic engine in Phase D/F.
  3. `playwright.config.ts` / `playwright-fixture.ts` imported the non-existent
     `lovable-agent-playwright-config` (Playwright could not run at all). Replaced with a standard
     `@playwright/test` config (`testDir: e2e`, webServer = `vite preview` on 127.0.0.1:4173,
     screenshot on failure).
  4. `src/test/example.test.ts` (`expect(true).toBe(true)`) — a test that cannot fail — deleted
     and replaced by `src/test/palette-lock.test.ts` (5 assertions on the LOCKED palette),
     **mutation-verified**: mutating `--primary` to `120 100% 21%` made it FAIL with
     `AssertionError: expected '120 100% 21%' to be '120 100% 20%'`, then the file was restored
     exactly (`RESTORED_OK`).
  5. `tsc -b` leaked untracked `*.tsbuildinfo` files into the tree — added to `.gitignore`.
- `npm run validate` baseline: **RED as designed** — 18 vendor-term, 2 non-determinism,
  4 network violations; 2 checks PASS; 5 SKIP (files not yet created).
- Commit scaffolding: **DONE** — `a2a5b7c`; `git status --short` empty at that commit.
- Playwright Chromium binary: **NOT installed yet** (`npx playwright install chromium` before
  Phase H). No `e2e/` specs exist yet.

### Phase A — Audit
**Status: DONE** — completed in the planning session; findings summarised here.

Verified audit facts (by command, not assumption):
- Repo is ONE page: `src/App.tsx` routes only `/` → `Index.tsx` and `*` → `NotFound.tsx`.
- NO homepage, NO departments, NO session/login, NO simulation visualisation, NO assessment
  screen, NO PDF/Word/print/share, NO service layer, NO persistence in the existing app.
- EXIST: coat of arms (`src/assets/zimbabwe-coat-of-arms.png`), emerald/gold palette, full
  shadcn/ui library (48 primitives incl. `chart.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`, `tabs.tsx`), `HeaderBar`,
  `KPICards`, `EngineStatus`, `AgentFeed`, `HistoryTable`, `DocumentLibrary`, `PolicyInput`
  (drag/drop upload), `SovereignFooter`, `StatusPill`, `NavLink`.
- Problems found: `index.html` loads Puter CDN + Google Fonts (external network);
  `PolicyInput.tsx:26-27` calls `window.puter.ai.chat`; `Math.random()` at `AgentFeed.tsx:64`
  and `PolicyInput.tsx:76`; hardcoded data duplicated across 5 components; `src/App.css` dead
  and would break layout if imported; `playwright.config.ts` + `playwright-fixture.ts` import
  `lovable-agent-playwright-config` which is NOT installed (Playwright cannot run);
  `eslint.config.js` has react-hooks rules at `warn` not `error`; no `typecheck` script;
  `src/test/example.test.ts` is `expect(true).toBe(true)`; `node_modules` was absent;
  both `bun.lock` and `package-lock.json` present.

### Phase B — Homepage + 16-department grid + self-hosted fonts
**Status: NOT STARTED**

### Phase C — One-click department session (persistence + route guard)
**Status: NOT STARTED**

### Phase D — Dashboard simplification (department-aware, terminology scrub, secondary nav)
**Status: NOT STARTED**

### Phase E — Policy input (Upload / Paste wired to the service)
**Status: NOT STARTED**

### Phase F — Simulation (deterministic visualisation + progress + Assessment Complete)
**Status: NOT STARTED**

### Phase G — Assessment (Executive Summary, Full Assessment, PDF/Word/Print/Email)
**Status: NOT STARTED**

### Phase H — Verification (full suite + Playwright journey for all 16 departments)
**Status: NOT STARTED**

### Phase I — Push + review zip
**Status: NOT STARTED** (push ONLY when every suite is green; never to `main`).

## Known-red / open items
- `npm run validate` is **RED until Phase D** (expected, not a regression): 18 vendor-term hits
  (`OASIS`/`GraphRAG` in `AgentFeed`/`EngineStatus`/`HeaderBar`, `puter` in `PolicyInput`,
  `Vultr` in `SovereignFooter`, the Puter `<script>` in `index.html`), 2 `Math.random()` hits
  (`AgentFeed`, `PolicyInput` parse progress), and 4 network URLs in `index.html` (Google Fonts
  x3 + Puter). This list IS the Phase B–E work.
- Playwright config is repaired but the **Chromium binary is not installed** yet
  (`npx playwright install chromium` before Phase H). No `e2e/` specs exist yet.
- 7 residual `react-refresh/only-export-components` **warnings** in stock shadcn/ui files
  (badge, button, form, navigation-menu, sidebar, sonner, toggle) — pre-existing, non-blocking;
  changing them buys nothing and risks the preserve-UI constraint.
- `npm install` reported 3 unapproved install scripts (`fsevents`, `esbuild`). esbuild's
  postinstall is a fallback path (`@esbuild/darwin-arm64` ships the binary via optional deps);
  the baseline build PASSED, so this is not blocking.

## RESUME HERE
- Branch: `feature/unified-platform` · HEAD after Phase 0: `a2a5b7c` (tree clean at that commit).
- Baseline tag: `baseline-pre-unified-platform` (`7451db0`) — the original app, always restorable
  with `git checkout main` or `git checkout baseline-pre-unified-platform`.
- Next action: **Phase B** — create `src/config/brand.ts`, `src/config/reference.ts`,
  `src/config/departments.ts` (all 16 departments with the exact stable IDs), self-host Inter +
  JetBrains Mono, remove the Puter + Google Fonts CDN references from `index.html`, and build
  `src/pages/Home.tsx` + `src/components/departments/DepartmentGrid.tsx` (16 keyboard-accessible
  buttons). Then re-run `npm run validate` (expect vendor + network counts to reach 0) and wire
  the routes in `src/App.tsx`.
- Read next: this file, then `src/index.css`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `index.html`, `src/App.tsx`,
  `src/components/HeaderBar.tsx` (the visual language to preserve).
- Exact commands:
```bash
npm run validate; npm run typecheck; npm run lint; npm test; npm run build
git add -A && git commit -m "feat(phase-b): homepage, 16-department config, self-hosted fonts"
```
